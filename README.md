# Simple-Linear-Regression
This program helps to predict the score based on the studytime based on Simple Linear Regression.

A simple dataset containing study time and exam score are loaded into the notebook. Further it is processed, modeled and predictions are made.

1. Data Preprocessing:
In this section, the data is processed and checked for the imperfections in the data. If any imperfections found, it is rectified in order to avoid errors during analysis.
2. Data Visualization
Visualizations are made to identify the trends in the data and to analyze the relationship between variables.
3. Data Modeling
In data modeling, various models such as linear regression are applied to the model and trained. 
5. Predictions
Based on the models, predictions are made out of the available data.
